# Benchmarking planners available in Moveit!

```

We use moveit

We have proposed a series of benchmark problems that are designed to exercise the planners in different scenarios focused 
specially on common manipulation problems. 

Different set of queries were defined in each scenario with difficult levels of difficulty with the intention of testing
the performance of the planners. 

These sets of benchmark problems intend to help the community to be a stating point and we encurage the scientific community
to contribute with more scenes and queries that exwecise other capabilities of planners.
