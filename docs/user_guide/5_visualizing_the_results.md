# Visualizing the results

After the benchmarks are executed, the [different metrics](user_guide/3_benchmark_description.md#benchmark-metrics) are 
computed and written to a logfile. MoveIt! supply a script (moveit_benchmark_statistics.py) to parse this data and plot the statistics.

```bash
rosrun moveit_ros_benchmarks moveit_benchmark_statistics.py <path_of_logfile>
```

To generate a PDF of plots:

python -p <plot_filename> moveit_benchmark_statistics.py <path_of_logfile>
Alternatively, upload the database file generated by moveit_benchmark_statistics.py to plannerarena.org and interactively visualize the results.

MoveIt! provides a script to visualize the results of the benchmarks in a pdf that was generated by a python script. 
However that was generated for each experiment and each graph was located in an entire page which make it difficult to compare the results. 

We have improve the visualization of the results with a graphical user interface (see Figure)  that:
* Allows to choose the benchmark database to visualize
* Displays the scene in rviz
* Show information about the experiments performed on the selected database and also information about the benchmark metrics used in the graphs.
* Displays several graphs in one screen summarizing the results for each planner
* Displays the results per each query selecting a specific planner which will be useful to analyze the output of the different quality metrics

To run the benchmark visulizer, execute the following command:
```bash
roslaunch sr_moveit_planner_benchmarking benchmarks_visualizer.launch
```
